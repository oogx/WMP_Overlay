# Windows Media Player Legacy Overlay

This started as an OpenCV project and ended up just releasing the overlay and example as i found a better way.
Feel free to modify any and all files to how you please.
It uses windows media player legacy and makes the screen maximised and invisible which gives the illusion of a overlay without having the detection vectors of directly drawing on a process.
If you used this repository please feel free to star it and give me a follow, Thank you.
